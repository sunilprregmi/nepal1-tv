# Nepal1 TV - Unofficial Website

This is an **unofficial website** for Nepal 1 TV, providing a modern platform for viewers to access Nepali news, entertainment, and culture.

I started this project because, while **Nepal 1 TV's transmission is still live**, their official website hasn't been updated since **2008**.

The original site was last mirrored on August 9, 2008 from nepal1tv.com.

The initial website, created in **2003**, was developed by **Dreams & Ideas**, a service provider specializing in Web, Print, and Multimedia.

## Project Status
ðŸš§ **Work in Progress**  
I'm currently working on making the website responsive for small screens and integrating live transmission with live feed information.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** for the website structure
- **CSS3** for styling (including flexbox and responsive design)
- **JavaScript** for dynamic elements and interactivity

## Contributions
**You Can Help Too**

This project is in its initial stages, and I would love your support! Specifically, if you have any information such as:
- Staff details
- Contact information
- Advertising or agency details
